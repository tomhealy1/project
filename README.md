## 1.1 Background of the dateset
R.A. Fisher's Iris Dataset AKA Anderson Dataset [Fisher Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) was used in the his 1936 paper [The use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems](http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf). The original paper can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x).

The resulting analysis done by R.A. Fisher is performed on a dateset that was compiled by  Edgar Anderson in 1935. The iris were The data were taken from the [Gaspe Peninsula](https://goo.gl/maps/yFc3grbU6NN2). The dataset is sometimes called the Anderson data set.

The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. 50 form each type of iris; _iris setosa_, _iris virginica_ and _iris versicolor_.

 Anderson took the measurement of 4 characterics of the flowers:

1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

Fisher was a very interesting character. He is seen as one of the founding fathers of statistics. His influence can be seen in areas such as linear discrimant analysis, analysis of variance(ANOVA), hypothesis testing and design of experiments.

## 1.2 Approach to the project
I had a look at the previling data science project models, the ones I found most relevant were:
<ul>
    <li>CRISP-DM</li>
    <li>DELTA framework by Tom Davenport</li>
    <li>KDD Framework </li>
</ul>
After researching the various models, I have decided to apply the CRISP-DM as far as is practicible.

The stages are:
<ul>
    <li>1. Business Understanding</li>
            *In this case, we have been asked to provide analysis on the Iris Data Set
        <li>2. Data Understanding</li>
                *This stage involves initial data collection,understanding data quality problems and  some first insights in to the data.
                *What data do we have?
            <li>What are the summary details of the data</li>
            <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
        <li>3. Data Prep</li>
                <li>Preparation of the dataset to construct the final data set</li>
                <li>Data Cleaning</li>
        <li>4. Modelling</li>
            <li>Select modelling techniques and apply</li>
            <li>Prediction</li>
        <li>5. Evaluation</li>
            <li>How to evaluate the the model.</li>
            <li>How accurate is the model?</li>
</ul>
