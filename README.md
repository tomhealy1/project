R.A. Fisher's Iris Dataset  [Fisher Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) was used in the his 1936 paper [The use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems](http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf). The original paper can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x).
